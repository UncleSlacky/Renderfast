Amstrad CPC port of the ZX Spectrum raytracer by Gabriel Gambetta in Locomotive BASIC

This is a raytracing program based on the ZX Spectrum implementation described on this page: https://gabrielgambetta.com/zx-raytracer.html, specifically the "optimised" version here: https://gabrielgambetta.com/zx-raytracer-3-src.html. It takes a little under 2 hours to run in mode 0 (I would guess mode 1 would take roughly twice as long, and two of the balls would have to be the same colour). I could probably improve it a bit by setting the ORIGIN to the centre of the screen etc. but it probably wouldn't be any faster. I haven't looked into adding reflections or shading, either, so if anyone wants to add them, be my guest!
